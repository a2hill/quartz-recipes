# Description
These Fondant Potatoes (aka melting potatoes) are absolutely out of this world delicious! They’re definitely a special occasion type of recipe, but 100% worth the effort. They're seared and then baked until perfectly golden and tender.

# Ingredients
- [ ] 4-5 large Yukon gold potatoes, sliced into 1” rounds
- [ ] Avocado oil (or another high heat oil)
- [ ] Salt and pepper to taste
- [ ] 4-6 tbsp butter (regular or vegan)
- [ ] 8-10 cloves garlic
- [ ] 4-5 sprigs each of rosemary and thyme
- [ ] 1 cup vegetable stock

# Method
1. Preheat oven to 425˚F.
2. Slice **potatoes** into 1” thick rounds. Use a small cookie cutter to cut into evenly-sized cylinders. (This is to help the **potatoes** cook at an even rate. We use the leftover **potato** scraps to make a breakfast hash the next day, or mashed **potatoes**!)
3. Place the **potatoes** in a bowl of cold water and soak for 15 minutes, then pat completely dry.
4. Meanwhile, heat **avocado oil** in a stainless steel 10” fry pan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium just before adding in the **potatoes**. Add in the **potatoes** and sear for 3-5 minutes on one side, until golden brown and crispy. Season with **salt**.
5. Flip the **potatoes** over, season with **salt** and sear for another 3-5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Using tongs and a paper towel, soak up as much of the frying oil as possible (turn off the heat for this step).
6. Return to medium heat and add in **butter**, **garlic**, **herbs**, **salt** and **pepper** to taste. Heat the **butter** until foamy and hot, but do not brown it. Baste the **potatoes** with **butter**. Pour in **vegetable stock**, remove from stovetop and place in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, until completely tender on the interior. Enjoy!
