# Description
A take on a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza from the 80's  

---
# Notes
## 2023-09-09
* Added pepperoni on half, which was a nice addition
* Did 50g Parmigiano Reggiano because we didn't have Pecorino Romano
* During the bake the cheese ended up oozing out to the edge causing a cheese crust to form, which was nice
### Liked
* Dough
* Sauce
* Cheese flavor
### Disliked
* Not enough sauce
* Cheese slippage
	* With this amount of cheese you are going to get slippage if it goes on top of the sauce 
### Next Time
* Do it Detroit style, sauce on top
## 2023-11-03
* Layered as follows
	* sliced low moisture moz
	* Sauce
	* Oregano and flakes
	* cubed high moisture moz 
	* grated moz
	* grated hard
	* onion
	* Pep
	* More grated moz and hard
	* Sauce racing stripes

### Liked
* no cheese slippage with this sauce technique
* Good sauce flavor
* Better browning this time, could have just been the oven though
### Disliked
* the cheese flavor was not as intense, could be because I didn’t use part skim and full fat like he calls for. Could have also been because of the extra sauce and pep
* had liquid pooling in the middle, could have been because of:
	* Low moisture moz (although this is unchanged from last time)
	* tomatoes weren’t drained before making sauce
	* Lots of bubbles in the pizza dough causing it to all drain to one place

# Method
1. Preheat the oven with pizza stones to 475°F (250°C).
2. Immediately after taking the par-baked pizza out of the oven, spread the tomato sauce onto the entire pizza, leaving about ½ inch (12 mm) around the dough's edge for the crust.
3. Dust the pizza with oregano, chile flakes, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and Pecorino.
4. Evenly distribute the fresh mozzarella, then both shredded mozzarellas.
5. Transfer the pizza to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown. The time will vary depending on your oven.
6. Remove the pizza from the pan with an offset spatula and transfer to a cooling rack.
7. Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before cutting into 8 slices.
