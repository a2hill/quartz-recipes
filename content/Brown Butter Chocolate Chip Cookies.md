# Method
1. Add the **butter** to a medium sauce pan and heat it over medium heat. Allow the **butter** to melt and come to a simmer. Simmer until the **butter** is foamy, giving off a nutty scent and has browned. The whole process should take about 5-8 minutes. Remove the **butter** from the heat and transfer it to a bowl to cool to room temperature. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the pan to get all the brown bits. The **brown butter** should be cooled but still liquid.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk the **flour**, **baking powder**, **baking soda**, **cornstarch** and **salt** together. Then set aside the **flour mixture**.
4. Pour the cooled **brown butter** into a large bowl. Add in the **brown sugar** and **granulated white sugar** and whisk together. It will be liquidy at first but will firm up as you&#39;re mixing. (You can also use a stand mixer if you prefer, I just personally think a whisk is easier!)
5. Add in the **egg yolks**, **vanilla** and **heavy cream** and whisk together until pale in color and smooth. (Scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary.)
6. Add the **dry ingredients** to the **wet ingredients** and fold in with a rubber spatula just until combined.
7. Add in the **chocolate chunks** and fold into the dough with a rubber spatula.
8. Scoop the dough with a large, 2 tablespoon capacity cookie scoop. (I kind of overfill my scoop to give me extra large cookies.)
9. Arrange the balls of dough 2 inches apart on a parchment paper lined baking sheet; bake 6 cookies at a time. Top with a few extra **chocolate chunks** and bake for 10 minutes until a light golden brown. When the cookies are straight out of the oven, scoot a large circular cookie cutter around them to give them a perfect circular shape!Let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet for five minutes then transfer them to a wire rack to completely cool. While they&#39;re cooling, sprinkle a little **flaky sea salt** on top of each cookie.
