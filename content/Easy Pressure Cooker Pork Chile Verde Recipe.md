# Method
1. In a pressure cooker, combine **pork**, **tomatillos**, **poblano peppers**, **Anaheim peppers**, **serrano peppers**, **onion**, **garlic**, **cumin**, and a big pinch of **salt**. Heat over high heat until gently sizzling, then seal pressure cooker, bring to high pressure, and cook for 30 minutes. Release pressure.

2. Using tongs, transfer **pork** pieces to a bowl and set aside. Add **cilantro** and **fish sauce** to remaining contents in pressure cooker. Blend with an immersion blender or in a countertop blender, then season to taste with **salt**. Return **pork** to sauce and stir gently to combine. Serve immediately with tortillas and lime wedges.
