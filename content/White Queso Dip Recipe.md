# Method
1. Heat **evaporated milk** over medium-high heat in a small saucepan. Stir in the **cornstarch** and whisk to combine.
2. Once simmering (bring it to just before boil--when it starts bubbling up the sides, it's ready), immediately reduce heat to low.
3. Immediately stir in the cheese in batches, starting with the **white american cheese**. As you stir in the cheese, increase heat to medium/low and whisk CONSTANTLY while the cheese melts. Once each batch is melted and creamy, add more. Don't stop stirring--you have to whisk the entire time while adding cheese.
4. Once done with the **white American cheese**, add in the shredded **Mozzarella**. Again, whisk CONSTANTLY while the cheese melts, insuring you have a creamy blend. If you prefer the cheese a bit thicker, add a bit more Mozzarella.
5. Once all the cheese is melted, stir in the **jalapenos**, **chili powder**, **nutmeg**, **red pepper**, and **salt** and **pepper** (see note).
6. (Optional) If you want the queso to be a bit browned (as pictured), pour the queso into a skillet and place in the oven. Broil for 3-4 minutes, or until cheese begins to bubble and brown.
7. Top with **cilantro**, **tomatoes**, and more **jalapenos** if desired.
8. Serve with tortilla chips and enjoy!
