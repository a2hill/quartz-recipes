-   1 teaspoon ground bay leaves

## Process
mince, press, or crush the garlic, then mix it with the remaining rub ingredients in a bowl. You can store this for later use or you can mix it with the water to make a paste and use it right away. To make the paste, add about half the water and stir. If it is too thick, add more water until you have a slurry that spreads thickly. To use the paste, coat the brined meat with it and start cooking.
