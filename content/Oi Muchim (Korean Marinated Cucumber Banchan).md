# Description
These marinated Korean cucumbers are tart, spicy, and just a touch sweet. You may not want dill pickles again.

# Ingredients
- [ ] 4 Persian cucumbers (about 10 1/2 ounces; 300g), sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds
- [ ] 1 tablespoon (8g) coarse ground **gochugaru** (Korean chili flakes)
- [ ] 1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) **kosher salt**
- [ ] 1 teaspoon (5g) **sugar**
- [ ] 2 tablespoons (30ml) unseasoned **rice wine vinegar**
- [ ] 1 teaspoon (5ml) **fish sauce**
- [ ] 1 medium **garlic** clove (5g), finely minced or grated
- [ ] 3 tablespoons (45ml) toasted **sesame oil**
- [ ] 1 tablespoon (10g) toasted **sesame seeds**

# Method
1. In a medium bowl, combine cucumbers, **gochugaru**, **salt**, and **sugar**. Using clean hands, massage cucumbers, squeezing and tossing them with seasoning, until cucumber is well-coated on all sides and begins to release liquid and color of **gochugaru** brightens to vibrant orange-red, about 1 minute.
2. Transfer cucumbers to a colander, then set colander inside bowl used to season cucumbers. Cut a round of parchment paper large enough to cover surface of cucumbers, and place over cucumbers. Then place a weight on top of parchment to press down on cucumbers (canned goods, a cast iron skillet, a mixing bowl filled with water, or a Chef's Press all make for good weights). Set aside to drain for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
3. Meanwhile, in a separate medium bowl, whisk together **rice wine vinegar**, **fish sauce**, and **garlic**. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in **sesame oil** until emulsified.
4. Once cucumbers have drained, remove weight and discard parchment paper. Using clean hands, squeeze cucumbers to get rid of excess moisture, then transfer to bowl with dressing; discard accumulated cucumber liquid. Toss cucumbers with dressing until well-coated all over, about 30 seconds. Add **sesame seeds** and toss to combine. Divide between small individual serving bowls and serve, or transfer to airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
