# Method
1. Prepare a water bath in a 300°F/150°C oven (see page 29).
2. Combine the **pork shoulder** and **back fat** and grind through a ¼-inch/6-millimeter die into a metal bowl set in an ice bath. Transfer one-third of this mixture to the grinding tray, add the **chicken livers**, and grind through a ⅛-inch/3-millimeter die.
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the ground meat and mix until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
4. Line a 1½-quart/1.5-liter terrine mold with plastic wrap and fill it with the pâté. Fold the plastic wrap over the top.
5. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil and cook in the water bath to an internal temperature of 145°F/63°C.
6. Remove the terrine from the water bath. When it's cool enough to handle, weight the terrine (see page 30) and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.
7. Unmold, slice, and serve (see page 30).
