# Method
1. In a large bowl, combine the **flour** and **salt**.
2. Add the diced **butter** and **lard**. Using both hands, pinch the fat into the flour and continue working it until the mixture resembles coarse meal; it should not become too warm or pasty.
3. Add the **water** and **vinegar** and mix until a dough forms.
4. Shape the dough into a log about 10 by 4 inches/25 by 10 centimeters. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.
5. When ready to use, slice the dough into 1 inch/2.5 centimeter thick disks and let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before rolling.
6. **YIELD:** ABOUT 2 POUNDS/1 KILOGRAM DOUGH
7. **NOTE:** Although the dough can be rolled out after an hour, it is best to let it rest for at least 6 hours before rolling.
