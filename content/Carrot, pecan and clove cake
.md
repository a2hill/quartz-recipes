# Method
<!-- In this section, any time you reference an ingredient (onions, chicken, cheese, garlic, etc.) be sure to bold it. For example 'Add the garlic' becomes 'Add the **garlic**'. Don't forget about things like **salt** **pepper** and **seasonings** which may not have been listed in the ingredients --> 
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C, gas mark 4. Grease 2 x 20cm loose-based cake tins with oil and line the bases with baking parchment. In a large bowl, lightly beat together the **oil**, **eggs** and **orange zest and juice**. Sieve in the **flour**, then add the **baking powder**, **bicarbonate of soda**, **sugar**, **spices** and **salt**; gently fold through. Stir in the **carrots** and most of the **pecans**, reserving some to decorate.
2. Pour the mixture into the tins and bake for 25-30 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the middles comes out clean. Leave the cakes to cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely.
3. Make the icing. Use electric beaters to beat the **butter** until pale and smooth.
Add the **icing sugar**, **maple syrup**, **cloves** and **soft cheese** and beat again until combined. Once the cake has cooled, use the icing to sandwich the cake together and also to ice its top. Decorate with the reserved **pecans**.
