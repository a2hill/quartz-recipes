# Method
1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
2. In a small bowl, combine **salt**, **black pepper**, **minced garlic**, and **minced thyme**. Add **olive oil** and mix until well combined.
3. Place **beef tenderloin** on a baking sheet and rub the seasoning mixture all over the meat.
4. In a large skillet, heat **olive oil** and **butter** over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the **beef tenderloin** and sear on all sides until browned, about 3-4 minutes per side.
5. Transfer the **beef tenderloin** to a roasting pan and roast in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 135°F for medium-rare.
6. Remove the **beef tenderloin** from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
7. In the same skillet used to sear the beef, add **onion** and **mushrooms**. Cook until the mushrooms are browned and the onions are translucent, about 5-7 minutes.
8. Add **minced garlic**, **minced thyme**, **salt**, and **black pepper**. Cook for an additional minute.
9. Pour in **red wine** and scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze it.
10. Add **beef broth** and let it simmer until the liquid is reduced by half.
11. Stir in **heavy whipping cream** and let it cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.
12. Serve the sliced **beef tenderloin** with the mushroom sauce on top. Enjoy!
