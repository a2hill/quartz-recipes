# Method
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Place **croissant** pieces in a 9 inch square pan or deep dish pie plate. Sprinkle with **blueberries**.
3. Beat **cream cheese** and **sugar** until well blended. Add the **eggs**, **lemon juice**, **lemon zest**, and **vanilla** in medium bowl with electric mixer until well blended. Gradually add **milk**, beating well after each addition. Pour evenly over **croissant** pieces. Let stand 20 minutes or soak overnight.
4. Bake at 350Â°F for 35 to 40 minutes or until set in center and golden brown. Check the dish halfway through baking...you may want to cover it with foil for the last 10 minutes if the tops are getting too browned.
5. Serve warm sprinkled with powdered sugar.
