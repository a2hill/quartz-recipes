# Method
<!-- In this section, any time you reference an ingredient (onions, carrots, celery, garlic, etc.) be sure to bold it. For example 'Add the garlic' becomes 'Add the **garlic**'. Don't forget about things like **salt** **pepper** and **seasonings** which may not have been listed in the ingredients --> 
1. Combine the **onion**, **carrots**, **celery**, **garlic**, **mushrooms**, **thyme**, **sage**, **rice**, 4 cups of the **water**, and 2 teaspoons **salt** in the Instant Pot and secure the lid.
2. Move the steam release valve to Sealing and select Manual/Pressure Cook to cook on high pressure for 25 minutes.
3. When the cooking cycle is complete, let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes, then move the steam release valve to Venting to release any remaining pressure. When the floating valve drops, remove the lid.
4. Stir in the **coconut milk**.
5. Season with additional **salt** and **pepper**, to taste, and serve immediately with a squeeze of fresh **lemon** to brighten the flavors and a few sprigs of **thyme**.
6. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 5 days.
