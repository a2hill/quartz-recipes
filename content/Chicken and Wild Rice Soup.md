# Method
1. In a large dutch oven, melt the **butter** over low heat. Once the butter has melted, add the **carrots**, **celery**, and **onion**. Season with a pinch of **salt** and a few grinds of **pepper** and cook over medium heat until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the **garlic**, **wild rice**, and the **flour**. Stir to combine and cook for 1-2 minutes to lightly toast the rice and cook the flour.
3. Slowly add the **chicken stock**, stirring constantly. Add the **herbs** and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer for 40-45 minutes, until the rice is very nearly cooked through.
4. Stir in the **shredded chicken** and the **heavy cream**; continue cooking until the chicken is warmed through and the rice is tender, another 5-10 minutes.
5. Season with **salt** and **pepper** to taste before serving.
