# Method
1. In a glass or other non reactive bowl, **thoroughly mix together the lamb, ginger, garlic, turmeric, coriander, cumin, and cayenne pepper**. Cover, and set aside in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight.
2. Fry the potatoes. Add the vegetable oil to a small, deep saucepan to a depth of about an inch. Heat the oil over medium high heat. When the oil is hot, add the potatoes, making sure that they are completely covered in hot oil. Fry the potatoes for about 10 - 15 minutes, until they show a very slight tinge of brown and have developed a 'skin.' Using a slotted spoon remove the potatoes from the oil and drain on paper towels.
3. Heat the mustard oil in a heavy bottomed 6-quart Dutch oven or saucepan over medium heat until the oil is really hot. When the oil begins to smoke, scatter in the sugar and follow immediately with the onions. Stir continually and fry the onions until they brown, but do not let them burn.
4. Add all the meat at once and fry, stirring often, until the meat is lightly browned all over. This will take about 10 minutes.
5. Add 1¼ cups of hot water and stir in the salt.
6. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower the heat, and simmer gently for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally during this period to make sure the meat does not stick to the bottom of the pan.
7. Gently add the fried potato halves potatoes to the pot, cover once again, and simmer for an additional 40 minutes, once again stirring occasionally to make sure that the meat and potatoes do not stick to the bottom of the pan. **Add additional hot water during this period, one tablespoonful at a time if it appears that that curry is getting too dry.**
