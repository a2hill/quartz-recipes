# Method
1. Fill a mixing bowl with ice water.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the **fresh mint**, and blanch for 20 seconds.
3. Immediately transfer the mint to the ice water and set aside to cool.
4. Put the **parsley**, blanched **mint**, and **dried mint** in a blender.
5. Blend on medium speed and, with the motor running, drizzle in the **oil**.
6. The herbs should puree and the mixture emulsify.
7. Increase the speed to high and continue to blend for 2 more minutes, until you begin to see steam rise and the emulsion begins to break, with the green oil separating from the herbs.
8. Pour the herbed oil into a mixing bowl set in a large bowl of ice so that it cools quickly.
9. Once it has cooled, about 5 minutes, strain the oil through a coffee filter. (Note: This may take several hours.)
10. Discard the herb pulp and transfer the oil to a sealed container.
