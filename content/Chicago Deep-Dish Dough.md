# Description
This Chicago Deep-Dish Dough recipe is made with Ceresota flour, an unbleached, unbromated all-purpose flour made from hard red winter wheat. It is a relatively low-gluten flour that is the traditional choice of Chicago pizzerias. The dough is made with equal parts butter and lard, giving it a unique flavor and texture. It needs to proof for at least 24 hours, but can be left for up to 48 hours for even better results.

# Method
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the yeast and warm water until the yeast dissolves and the mixture foams.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour, cornmeal, and malt. With the mixer running on the lowest speed, add the lard and butter and mix for 1 minute.
3. Pour in most of the ice water, reserving about 2 tablespoons, followed by the yeast-water mixture. Pour the reserved water into the yeast bowl, swirl it around to dislodge any bits of yeast stuck to the bowl, and add to the mixer.
4. Continue to mix the dough at the lowest speed for about 1 minute, until most of the dough comes together around the hook. Stop the mixer and use your fingers to pull away any dough that clings to the hook, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl with a bowl scraper or rubber spatula.
5. Add the salt and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute to combine.
6. Check the bottom of the bowl for any unincorporated flour. Turn the dough over and press it into the bottom of the bowl to pick up any stray pieces.
7. Stop the mixer, pull the dough off the hook, and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. If there is still unincorporated flour at the bottom of the bowl, sprinkle with a very small amount of water and mix for 1 minute.
8. Use a bowl scraper to transfer the dough to an unfloured work surface and knead for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth.
9. Cover the dough with a damp dish towel and let it rest at room temperature for 1 hour.
10. Use a dough cutter to loosen the dough and move it to the scale. You will need 27 ounces (770 grams) of dough.
11. Form the dough into a ball and set it on a half sheet pan. Wrap the pan airtight with a double layer of plastic wrap, sealing the wrap well under the pan.
12. Refrigerate the dough for 24 to 48 hours before using.
Note: You can substitute 18 grams of vegetable shortening for the lard to make a vegetarian version of this dough.
