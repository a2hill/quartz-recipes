# Method
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a small bowl, beat together the **cream cheese**, 3 tbsp of **granulated white sugar**, and 1/2 tsp of **vanilla** until smooth. Set aside.
3. In a separate small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup of **granulated white sugar** and 2 tsp of **black cocoa powder**. Set aside.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of **all-purpose flour**, 1/2 cup of **black cocoa powder**, 1/2 tsp of **baking powder**, and 1/2 tsp of **salt**. Set aside.
5. In a large bowl, beat together 3/4 cup of **unsalted butter**, 3/4 cup of **light brown sugar**, and 1/4 cup of **granulated white sugar** until light and fluffy. Add in 2 **egg yolks** and 1 1/2 tsp of **vanilla** and mix until well combined.
6. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
7. Take about 1 tbsp of dough and flatten it in your hand. Place a small spoonful of the cream cheese mixture in the center and wrap the dough around it, rolling it into a ball. Roll the ball in the black cocoa sugar mixture and place it on the prepared baking sheet.
8. Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the edges are set. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your spooky black velvet cheesecake cookies!
