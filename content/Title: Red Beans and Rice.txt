# Method
1. In a large bowl or container, dissolve 3 tablespoons of salt in 4 quarts of cold water. Add beans and soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Drain and rinse well.
2. In a Dutch oven, heat bacon over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and fat is almost fully rendered, 5 to 8 minutes.
3. Add onion, green pepper, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, 6 to 7 minutes.
4. Stir in garlic, thyme, paprika, bay leaves, cayenne, and ¼ teaspoon black pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Stir in beans, water, and broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and vigorously simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are just soft and liquid begins to thicken, 45 to 60 minutes.
6. Stir in sausage and 1 teaspoon vinegar and cook until liquid is thick and beans are fully tender and creamy, about 30 minutes.
7. Season with salt, pepper, and additional vinegar to taste.
8. Serve over rice, sprinkling with scallions and passing hot sauce separately, if desired.
