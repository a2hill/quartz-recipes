# Description
Oatmeal adds a wholesome flavor and an interesting texture to this banana bread, and there are no wet chunks of banana in the bread because the wet ingredients are mixed in the blender. You still get the moisture, sweetness and most importantly flavor from the bananas.

# Method
1. Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a loaf pan; set aside. Place flour, sugar, oats, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium mixing bowl and stir to thoroughly combine. Set aside.
2. Place bananas, eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla in a blender and blend on medium speed for 15-10 seconds, until bananas are completely puréed. Don't blend too high, you don't want to incorporate a lot of air. Pour wet mixture into dry and fold just to incorporate. Scrape batter into prepared pan and bake for 30 minutes, then turn the pan and bake for another 25 to 30 minutes, until a skewer or paring knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove from oven and immediately run a paring knife around the edges of the loaf, then turn out onto a cooling rack and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Once cooled, loaf can be tightly wrapped and stored in refrigerator for 3-5 days or frozen for up to a month.
