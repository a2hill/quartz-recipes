# Method
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
2. In a medium to large mixing bowl, add the **lemon juice**, **olive oil**, **cheese**, and **lemon zest**. Mix until fully incorporated. If it becomes too thick, add a bit more olive oil. If it becomes too thin, add a little more cheese and mix well.
3. In a large skillet, heat about 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the **minced garlic** and saut√© until fragrant and lightly golden, about 1-2 minutes.
4. Add the **crushed red pepper flakes** and cook for another 30 seconds to infuse the garlic and red pepper flakes.
5. Turn the heat down to the lowest setting and add the **butter**, stirring until it melts.
6. Turn off the heat and immediately add the pasta to the skillet straight from the pot.
7. Add the lemon/cheese/olive oil mixture, then add 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water. Mix well until everything is incorporated.
8. Add the chopped parsley and mix until incorporated.
9. Add more cheese if desired for a creamier pasta.
