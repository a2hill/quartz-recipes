## Notes
* Pork shoulder is roughly 75% lean meaning we want additional 5% fat to hit 30% fat total
### 2023-11-12
* Ran out of Thyme so we subbed in other herbs to roughly the same total weight
### 2023-01-8
- Could probably just use black pepper next time
- too much cognac
- could use a lite more coarseness
