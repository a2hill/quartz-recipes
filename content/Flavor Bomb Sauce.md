# Description

This recipe is for a tomato flavor bomb and robust tomato sauce that can be used to add depth of flavor to any dish, especially pizza sauce. It is easy to make and will make your kitchen smell incredible.
# Ingredients

- 15 to 20 cloves garlic, peeled, or about 50 grams
- 1 sprig rosemary
- 2 sprigs basil
- 2 sprigs thyme
- 1 (794-gram/28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes (preferably Bianco DiNapoli), drained
- 5 grams (about a teaspoon) sea salt
- Pinch sugar or drizzle of honey (optional)
- 220 to 440 grams (1 to 2 cups) extra-virgin olive oil

# Method

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F (218°C).
2. Cover the bottom of a high sided, oven-safe pan with the garlic and herbs. Completely cover them with the tomatoes, arranged in one flat layer. Press down to remove as much air as possible. Evenly sprinkle the salt and sugar (if using) over the tomatoes.
3. Add enough of the olive oil to completely cover the tomatoes. If needed, gently push the tomatoes down with the back of a spoon.
4. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the garlic is completely soft. Carefully remove the pan from the oven; the oil will be very hot. Let it cool for 30 minutes.
5. Drain excess oil and remove the herbs. Refrigerate and reserve for another use.
6. Using an immersion blender, puree the tomato and garlic mixture until smooth and emulsified (it will be very orange because of the oil). Taste and adjust the seasoning.
7. Refrigerate until ready to use or up to 3 days.
8. You can integrate this at 10% to the Basic Tomato Sauce recipe (page 52) to up the flavor. Now it's Robust Tomato Sauce.

Note: This tomato flavor bomb and robust tomato sauce can be added to the Basic Tomato Sauce recipe to enhance the flavor.
