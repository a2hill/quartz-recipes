# Method
1. Combine **cumin**, **coriander**, **star anise**, **cloves**, **peppercorns**, **cinnamon**, **nutmeg**, **mace**, **turmeric**, and **cardamom** in a spice grinder and grind to a fine powder. Set aside.
2. Heat **oil**, **butter**, or **ghee** in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until melted (or until oil is shimmering). Add **onion**, **garlic**, **ginger**, and **chile**. Cook, stirring frequently, and scraping bottom of pan until golden brown and starting to burn in spots, about 10 minutes. Add **cayenne**, **cashews**, and half of **spice mixture**. Cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add **coconut milk** and remove from heat. Scrape up any browned bits from bottom of pan.
3. Transfer mixture to blender and starting a low speed, slowly increase speed to maximum. Blend until smooth, about 30 seconds. Return mixture to pot. Add **chickpeas**, **spinach**, and remaining **spice mix** and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until vegetables are heated through and spinach is wilted, about 10 minutes. Add **salt** and **lime juice** to taste. Stir in half of **cilantro**. Transfer to serving bowl, sprinkle with extra **cilantro**, and serve with **lime wedges**, **basmati rice pilaf**, **grilled naan**, and **cilantro chutney**, as desired.
