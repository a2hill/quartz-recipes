1. Boil 2 cups of water, or just enough to submerge the slab of pork belly, in a pan or wok.
2. Remove the parboiled pork belly from the boiling water and place it into the bowl of cold water.
3. Flip the pork belly skin-side down. Cut two long slashes into the meat side, making sure to not cut all the way through. Stop before you hit the skin.
4. Sprinkle salt over the skin and rub it all over.
5. Take your chilled pork belly out of the refrigerator.
