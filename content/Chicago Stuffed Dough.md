# Description
This dough is the same one I use for deep-dish pizza, but I've given you the proportions for both the bottom and top crust. You'll need to make one and a half times as much of it, so you will have enough for both.

# Ingredients
- [ ] 6.8 grams (21 teaspoons) active dry yeast
- [ ] 92 grams (14 cup plus 2 tablespoons) warm water (80°F to 85°F)
- [ ] 645 grams (51/3 cups) all-purpose flour with 12 percent protein, preferably Ceresota
- [ ] 34 grams (14 cup) medium-grind cornmeal
- [ ] 13.5 grams (1½ tablespoons) diastatic malt
- [ ] 27 grams (2 tablespoons) lard, cut into small pieces, at room temperature
- [ ] 27 grams (2 tablespoons) European-style unsalted butter, preferably 82 percent butterfat, cut into small pieces, at room temperature
- [ ] 316 grams (11 cups) ice water, plus more as needed
- [ ] 13.5 grams (23/4 teaspoons) fine sea salt

# Method
1. Make the dough as directed for [[Chicago Deep-Dish Dough]] up to the point where you have kneaded the dough.
2. Weigh out one 27-ounce (765-gram) piece of dough and one 14-ounce (400-gram) piece of dough.
3. Cover both pieces with a damp dish towel and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.
4. Form the pieces into balls (see Balling the Dough, page 26).
5. Set the balls 3 inches apart on a half sheet pan.
6. Wrap the pan and refrigerate as directed for Chicago Deep-Dish Dough.
Note on Making Vegetarian Deep-Dish Dough: You can substitute 18 grams vegetable shortening for the lard.
