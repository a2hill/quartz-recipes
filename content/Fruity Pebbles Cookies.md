# Method
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the **gluten free flour**, the **baking powder** and the **kosher salt**. Set aside.
2. In a small bowl, using a spoon, mix together the **cornstarch** and **water** until thin and watery. It will be thick and tacky at first.
3. In a large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or using a hand held mixer, beat the **room temperature butter** or **vegan baking stick** and 1 ¼ cups of **granulated sugar** until soft and creamy. About 2-3 minutes.
4. With the mixer on low speed, beat in the **cornstarch water mixture**. Then beat in the **vanilla**, **milk** and **orange juice**. The mixture might look slightly chunky and that’s ok.
5. Still on low speed, beat the **gluten free flour mixture** into the wet ingredients, a little at a time until just combined. Once combined, scrape down the sides of the bowl using a spatula.
6. Pour in 1/2 cup of the **rainbow cereal** and use a spatula to mix into the dough.
7. Cover the bowl with the dough still in it with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2.5 hours. This is very important. There are no eggs and if you don't do this step, the cookies will spread into a giant mess while baking.
8. After 2.5 hours, preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
9. Take the dough out of the fridge. Using an ice cream scoop, scoop the dough out. You should have 12 scoops.
10. Roll the dough balls in the extra 3/4 cup rainbow cereal, then roll each dough ball in the extra ¼ cup of granulated sugar. It must be in that order or else the cereal will not stick to the dough.
11. Place dough balls about 3-4 inches apart on the parchment lined baking sheet. Bake the cookies at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for 15-16 minutes or until golden brown on the bottoms. Carefully use a cookie spatula to check. Store extra dough balls in the fridge while the rest are baking if they don't all fit. I only bake 6 at a time.
12. Immediately reshape the cookies when they come out of the oven. Use a spatula to push the cookies back into a circle shape or use a large circle cookie cutter. If using a cookie cutter, place it over the cookies and rotate quickly in a circle. Top with extra Fruity PEBBLES™ if desired.
13. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 min before transferring to a cooling rack. If you don't do this, the cookies will break apart into a giant mess.
