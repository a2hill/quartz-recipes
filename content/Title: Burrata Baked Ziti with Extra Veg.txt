# Method
1. Note: I love to use leftover roasted or grilled vegetables for this recipe, which eliminates the step of sautéing them in the skillet. You can also roast or sauté the vegetables ahead of time to save a few minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the ziti until al dente, according to the package instructions.
3. While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-low heat and add the olive oil. Add in the **onions**, **peppers** and **garlic** with a big pinch of **salt** and **pepper**. Stir in the **basil**, **oregano** and **red pepper flakes**. Cook for 5 minutes, until slightly softened. Stir in the **zucchini** and cook for 3 minutes more. Stir in the **tomato paste**. Stir in the **red wine**.
4. Pour the **marinara sauce** in the skillet. Stir in the **parmesan** and toss everything together. By now, the pasta should be finished cooking. Place it in a 9x13 baking dish. Pour the marinara sauce mixture over top. Sprinkle on the **mozzarella cheese**, tossing once or twice to stir it into the pasta.
