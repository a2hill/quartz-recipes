# Method
1. If using day-old rice (see note), transfer to a medium bowl and break the rice up with your hands into individual grains before proceeding. Heat 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) **vegetable oil** in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until the rice is pale brown and toasted and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil and remaining rice.

2. Return all the rice to the wok and press it up the sides, leaving a space in the middle. Add 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil to the space. Add **onion**, **carrot**, **scallions**, and **garlic** and cook, stirring gently, until lightly softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss with rice to combine. Add **soy sauce** and **sesame oil** and toss to coat. Season to taste with **salt** and **white pepper**.

3. Push rice to the side of the wok and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil. Break the **egg** into the oil and season with a little **salt**. Use a spatula to scramble the egg, breaking it up into small bits. Toss the egg and the rice together.
