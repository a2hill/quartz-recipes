# Method
1. Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt in 4 quarts cold water in large bowl or container. Add **beans** and soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Drain and rinse well.
2. Heat **bacon** in Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and fat is almost fully rendered, 5 to 8 minutes. 
3. Add **onion**, **green pepper**, and **celery** and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, 6 to 7 minutes. 
4. Stir in **garlic**, **thyme**, **paprika**, **bay leaves**, **cayenne**, and ¼ teaspoon black pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
5. Stir in **beans**, **water**, and **broth** and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat and vigorously simmer, stirring occasionally, until **beans** are just soft and liquid begins to thicken, 45 to 60 minutes.
6. Stir in **sausage** and 1 teaspoon **vinegar** and cook until liquid is thick and **beans** are fully tender and creamy, about 30 minutes. Season with **salt**, **pepper**, and additional **vinegar** to taste. Serve over **rice**, sprinkling with **scallions** and passing **hot sauce** separately, if desired.
