# Method
1. coarsely chop the sage, thyme, garlic, jalapeño, and black pepper, and put it in a coffee cup. Mince or press the garlic and dump it in. Drizzle the oil on the pile and let it sit while you cook so the oil can draw out some of the flavor.
2. Pour the herb and oil mix onto the cutting board. Make sure it is level or it will spill over onto the table. A board with routed out channels is best to hold it all in.
3. Cut slices of tender meats about 1/2" (12.7 mm) thick across the grain, and tougher meats like flank steak, about 1/8" (3.2 mm) across the grain. Roll the meat in the board dressing so everybody gets a light coat just before serving.
