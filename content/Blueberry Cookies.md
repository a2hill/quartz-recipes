# Method
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a small saucepan, combine the blueberries, 1/4 cup (50 g) of sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and cornstarch. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and the blueberries burst, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
4. In a large bowl, beat the butter and 1 1/4 cups (250 g) of sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until well combined.
5. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined.
6. Fold in the cooled blueberry mixture.
7. Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie.
8. If desired, sprinkle the tops of the cookies with the remaining 1/4 cup (50 g) of sugar.
9. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.
10. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!
