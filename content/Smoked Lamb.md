# Ingredients
* [ ] 1 batch [[Amazing Ribs Lamb Paste]]
* [ ] .5 tsp Mortons Kosher Salt **per pound of meat**
	* This worked out to 16g for a 5lb (post trim) lamb leg
* [ ] ~6 lb boneless lamb leg (usually from costco)
* [ ] 1 batch [[Board Sauce Recipe]]
# Method
1. **Prep**. Start the day before if you can by removing as much of the thick fat cap on the surface as possible and all the silverskin underneath. Fat is what gives lamb it's gamey flavor. Remove the bones, or not. Your choice.
2. Now gash the surface by stabbing it repeatedly about 1/2" (13mm) deep and 1" (2.5cm) apart or run a sharp blade across the surface in a checkerboard pattern making squares 1 to 2" wide and about 1/2" (13mm) deep Â [Click here to read more about the technique of gashing](https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/marinades-and-brinerades/science-of-marinades-and-brinerades/). 
3. Sprinkle the salt all over the meat going lighter in the thinner areas.
4. Truss the roast

5. Put it in a pan, and leave it in the fridge overnight. (I did it for a few hours)
6. Swab the paste all over the meat and deep into the gashes.
7. Smoke at 250 until 136 internal temp
8. Pull and let rest for 30 minutes
9. While resting prepare a fire to sear
10. While fire is lighting prepare a [[Board Sauce Recipe]]
11. Sear
12. Carve  over the board sauce and serve
