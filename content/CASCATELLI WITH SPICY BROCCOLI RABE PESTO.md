# Description
This dish is a twist on traditional pasta salads, using a spicy broccoli rabe pesto as the sauce. It can also be easily customized by adding additional ingredients such as shrimp, chicken, or grilled veggies.

# Ingredients
- [ ] 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- [ ] 1 bunch **broccoli rabe** (about 1 pound), bottom 2 inches of the ends trimmed
- [ ] 6 tablespoons **extra-virgin olive oil**, plus more as needed
- [ ] 1 to 2 tablespoons **Calabrian chili paste** (bomba sauce; depending on desired spiciness), plus more for serving (see note on page 205)
- [ ] 1 **garlic clove**, peeled and smashed (see tip)
- [ ] 1 pound **cascatelli** (or vesuvio, radiatore, or cavatappi)
- [ ] Finely grated **Parmesan**, for serving (optional)

# Method
1. Bring 4 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of the salt to a boil in a large pot.
2. In a large bowl, combine about 4 cups of ice and 6 cups of cold water.
3. Add the **broccoli rabe** to the boiling water, making sure it's completely submerged, and cook until the stems are tender, about 2 minutes.
4. Use tongs to transfer the rabe to the ice bath and let sit for at least 2 minutes; keep the water in the pot at a boil.
5. Transfer the rabe to a strainer and use your hands to squeeze out the excess moisture, then add the rabe to the bowl of a blender or food processor (or immersion blender, see note).
6. Add the **oil**, **chili paste**, **garlic**, and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and blend until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as necessary.
7. (At this point the pesto can be kept, covered, at room temperature for a few hours before proceeding with the recipe. It can also be transferred to an airtight container and refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 2 months.)
8. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until just al dente (the low end of the package instructions).
9. Reserve 2 cups of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta and return it to the pot (off the heat).
10. Add the pesto and ¾ cup of the reserved pasta water and stir until the pasta is well coated. (If necessary, add more pasta water 2 tablespoons at a time until the sauce is creamy but clings to the pasta.)
11. Transfer the pasta to a serving dish or individual bowls, sprinkle with **Parmesan**, if desired, and serve with more **chili paste**.
12. If making ahead, as with any pasta you're transforming into a pasta salad, cover for up to 2 hours and toss with a drizzle of **olive oil** before serving.

TIP: Since the garlic is raw, we felt that one clove was sufficient, but if you love garlic, up it to two cloves. If you're very sensitive to the bite of raw garlic, you can blanch the clove in the boiling water for a few minutes right along with the rabe to soften the flavor before pureeing it into the pesto.

NOTE: Using a food processor will yield the most traditional pesto texture — well combined but with individual components still visible. If you use a blender, the pesto will be smoother and more velvety. You can use an immersion blender, but you may need to add a little extra **olive oil** to make sure it holds together well.
