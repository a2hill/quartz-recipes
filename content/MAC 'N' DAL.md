# Method
1. Rinse the **lentils** and **peas** in a fine-mesh strainer until the water runs clear.
2. To cook on the stovetop, soak the rinsed **lentils** and **peas** in cold water for at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours, then drain and transfer to a medium saucepan along with the **stock**, 1½ teaspoons of the **salt**, and 1 teaspoon of the **turmeric**.
3. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the **lentils** are cooked through and starting to fall apart, 30 to 40 minutes; it's okay if not all of the liquid has been absorbed.
4. To use a pressure cooker, transfer the rinsed **lentils** and **peas** to an electric pressure cooker (like an Instant Pot) along with the **stock**, 1½ teaspoons of the **salt**, and 1 teaspoon of the **turmeric**. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes and allow to naturally release for 10 minutes. Release the pressure and keep warm.
5. Meanwhile, bring 3 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of the **salt** to a boil in a pot.
6. Use a spice grinder or mortar and pestle to pulse or pound the **coriander** and **cumin** seeds until very coarsely ground.
7. Heat the **ghee** in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat until shimmering.
8. Add the **curry leaves**, **mustard seeds**, and crushed **coriander-cumin mixture** and cook, stirring often, until fragrant and the **coriander** and **cumin** turn a shade darker, 30 to 45 seconds.
9. Add the **shallots** and cook, stirring often, until golden around the edges, 4 to 7 minutes.
10. Add the **chili powder** and remaining ½ teaspoon of **turmeric** and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.
11. Stir in 1½ cups of **water**, the **tomatoes**, and the remaining 1 teaspoon of **salt**.
12. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, then cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the **tomatoes** start to break down, 4 to 7 minutes.
13. Stir in the cooked **lentil mixture** and any residual cooking liquid, cover, and reduce the heat to medium-low.
14. The sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. Reheat before proceeding with step 5 and note that it may tighten up quite a bit, so will need to be thinned with some pasta cooking water before serving.
15. Add the **pasta** to the boiling water and cook for 1 minute less than the low end of the package instructions.
16. Reserve 1 cup of the **pasta cooking water**, then drain the **pasta**, shaking off the excess water, and immediately transfer it to the pot with the **lentil mixture**.
17. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often, until the **pasta** is firm and meaty (al dente), 2 to 4 minutes.
18. If necessary, add the reserved **pasta water** 2 tablespoons at a time to loosen the sauce to your desired consistency.
19. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the **cilantro** and **lemon juice**, then transfer the **pasta and dal** to a serving bowl or individual bowls.
20. Dollop with **yogurt**, sprinkle with more **cilantro**, add a spoonful of **achaar**, if desired, and serve.
