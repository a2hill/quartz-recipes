# Description
Dal on pasta with a spoonful of achaar is one of my go-to weekday work-from-home lunches, but I admit I usually do it with packaged dal from the supermarket. Of course, doing it from scratch gives you even more depth of flavor—and it's very easy.

Dal refers to a subset of dried legumes as well as the dish that's made with those legumes. Recipes vary from region to region and even family to family, and you can make this recipe with any kind of dal you like, though cooking times may vary with larger varieties. Asha and I love a saucy mix of **masoor** and **toor dal** that's rich in **turmeric**, **coriander**, and **cumin**, with a touch of heat from **Kashmiri chilies** and herbaceous flavor from **curry leaves**. The red lentils (**masoor dal**) bring an earthy sweetness and cook up quickly, while the split pigeon peas (**toor dal**) offer a silky, almost buttery flavor and a luscious mouthfeel. We pair the dal with **lumache** ("snails"), a big, ridged elbow macaroni that's pinched at one end, which gives it a pouch-like quality, making it more sauceable than macaroni.

# Method
1. Rinse the lentils and peas in a fine-mesh strainer until the water runs clear. To cook on the stovetop, soak the rinsed lentils and peas in cold water for at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours, then drain and transfer to a medium saucepan along with the stock, 1½ teaspoons of the salt, and 1 teaspoon of the turmeric. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are completely tender and the peas are starting to break down, 20 to 30 minutes.
