# Method
1. Prep Work: Measure out ingredients before beginning, it makes the process easier and more relaxing. (Don't cut the potatoes yet.)
2. Pat the chicken dry and season each side with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.
3. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high heat. Make sure the pot is sufficiently heated so that the chicken sears right when it hits it. Add the chicken and cook for 3-4 minutes/side, then remove and set aside. (We want the middle to be uncooked.) Don’t cut up the chicken yet.
4. Turn off the heat. Add the wine and set the heat to medium. Use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Let the liquid reduce by half, about 4 minutes.
5. Add the butter and let it melt. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Toss to coat. Soften for 5 minutes.
6. Add the garlic, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and seasonings. Cook for 1 minute.
7. Add the flour and stir to combine. Cook for 2 minutes, or until it begins to turn a golden brown.
8. Add the chicken broth in small splashes, stirring continuously. Be sure to do this slowly. Add the heavy cream in the same manner. Next, add the chicken bouillon.
9. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Add the whole pieces of chicken back along with any juices from the plate.
10. Cover partially and let the soup bubble very gently, partially covered, for 45-60 minutes. It will reduce, thicken, and concentrate. Don’t let it reach a boil or the chicken will be tough/dry. (A few gentle bubbles are good.) Stir the soup occasionally as it cooks.
11. Use kitchen tongs to remove the chicken and set aside on a plate. Let it rest. Cut the potatoes into 3/4-inch chunks and add them to the soup. Simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes.
12. Dice or shred the chicken and discard any bones. Return it to the soup. Optional: Add a few drops of gravy master to add a slightly darker color to this stew. Taste and add any additional seasoning if desired. Serve with cheddar bay biscuits or buttermilk biscuits!
