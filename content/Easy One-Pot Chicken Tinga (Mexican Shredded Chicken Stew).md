# Method
1. Season **chicken** generously with **salt** and **pepper**. Heat **oil** in a medium saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add **chicken** skin-side-down and cook, without moving, until well-browned, 6 to 8 minutes. (Lower heat if pot is smoking excessively or **chicken** starts to burn). Flip **chicken** and cook on second side for 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate and immediately add **tomatillos**, **tomatoes**, and **garlic** to pot. Cook, flipping occasionally, until blistered and browned in spots, about 5 minutes.

2. Add **onion** and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add **oregano** and **bay leaves** and cook, stirring, until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add **vinegar** and **stock**. Return **chicken** to pot, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a bare simmer. Cover pot and cook, turning **chicken** occasionally, until **chicken** registers 145°F (63°C) when an instant-read thermometer is inserted into the center of thickest part, 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer **chicken** to a bowl and set aside. Continue cooking **sauce** at a hard simmer, stirring, until reduced to about half its original volume, about 5 minutes longer.

3. Add **chipotle chiles** and **adobo**, remove and discard **bay leaves**, and blend **sauce** using an immersion blender or by transferring to a countertop blender. **Sauce** should be relatively smooth, with a few small chunks. When **chicken** is cool enough to handle, discard skin and bones and finely shred meat. Return it to the **sauce**. Add **fish sauce** and stir to combine.

4. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until **sauce** thickens and coats **chicken**. It should be very moist but not soupy. Season to taste with **salt** and **pepper** (if necessary).
