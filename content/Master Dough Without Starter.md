# Method
1. Follow the instructions for [[Master Dough with Starter]], omitting the addition of the Poolish or Tiga and allow the dough to rest for 1 hour rather than 20 minutes.
2. Using a dough cutter, lift the dough into a large bowl, press it down slightly, and rub a little water over the top.
3. Cover with a double layer of plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours (see Bulk Fermenting, page 24).
4. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and put it in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.
5. Mix for 30 seconds on the lowest speed to degas the dough, removing any air bubbles (see Degassing the Dough, page 26).
6. Move the dough to the work surface and use the dough cutter to cut the dough into halves or thirds (depending on the weight called for in each recipe).
7. Weigh each piece, adjusting the quantity of dough as necessary.
8. You may have a little extra dough.
9. Form the dough into balls (see Balling the Dough, page 26) and refrigerate for 24 hours as directed in the Master Dough recipe.
10. For baker's percentages, see page 302.
