### Liked
* The dough was excellent, best bottom crunch in a dough so far
### Disliked
* The amount of time it took
### Next Time
* Try re-configuring without the 18 hour fridge rest
* Get the dough a little more stretched into the corners
## 2023-11-03
### Liked
* It took less time
### Disliked
* Bottom got way too done with a par bake plus regular bake on pizza steel
	* Maybe try putting a baking sheet under the stone to deflect the heat
* Crumb was too tight
	* Unsure what to do about this
* Had lots of irregular puffing during the par bake
	* Maybe don’t par bake?
* Crust pulled away from the pan edges during par bake, leaving gaps
### Next Time
* try experimenting with a blend of flours, possibly 00, to try and get a lighter crumb

# Ingredients
* [ ] 365g high-protein bread flour

* [ ] 237g 60-72 degree water
* [ ] .4g yeast
* [ ] 79g unsalted butter; divided

# Method
1. Weigh out each ingredient in separate containers.
2. Cube and refrigerate 22 grams of the butter. Melt 14 grams of the butter and set aside. Allow the remaining 43 grams of butter to come to room temperature.
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Using clean hands, mix thoroughly.
4. In another large mixing bowl, combine the water, yeast, and melted butter. Mix by hand, making sure to break up any large pieces.
5. Create a crater in the flour and pour the liquids in the center. Begin mixing with just your dominant hand until the dough lifts from the sides of the bowl and forms a ball. Stop mixing, cover with plastic wrap, and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
6. Remove the chilled butter from the refrigerator. Gradually add it to the rested dough and combine by gently stretching and folding. Continue for 10 minutes, then transfer to a lightly oiled container. Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 3 hours at room temperature.
7. Using the 43 grams room temperature butter, grease 1 (12-inch/30-cm diameter) round deep-dish pans and set aside (or 13.5"x10" Lloyd pan).
8. Shape dough into a ball by folding it in on itself. Transfer the dough to the buttered pan. Cover pan with plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for 3 hours.
9. Lift the dough and press out any air from the bottom of the pan. Using your fingertips, gently dimple the entire length of the dough. Cover and proof for another 3 hours, then transfer to the refrigerator and leave overnight or up to 18 hours.
10. Remove the dough and allow it to reach room temperature for 3 to 5 hours before baking.
11. To par-bake, preheat the oven with pizza stones to 475°F (250°C).
12. Remove the cover and par-bake the un-topped dough for 10 minutes. Note: Sometimes I par-bake, sometimes I don't. I like both methods, so you should try each method for yourself. Just add 10 minutes to the bake time if you skip the par-bake.
