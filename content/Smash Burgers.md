# Notes
## 2023-08-23
### Liked
* Did full slice of cheese between patties with another half slice on top
*  Diced onion is good
* Seasoned one side of each patty 
### Disliked
* Too juicy
* Diced onion and pickle kind of fall off
* Didnâ€™t use white onion and it was missing a bite
* Did Kroger white American, but remembered liking boars head yellow American 
## Next time
* Use white onion
* 90/10 ground beef
* Side by side for American cheese to see if the other brand is better
	* Kroger vs Boars Head
* Yellow mustard
