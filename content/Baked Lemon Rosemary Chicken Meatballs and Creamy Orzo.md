# Method
1. Preheat the oven to 450° F.
2. Add the **chicken**, **dijon**, **shallot**, **garlic powder**, **Italian seasoning**, **rosemary**, **paprika**, **salt**, **pepper**, and **parmesan** to a bowl. Mix to combine. Roll the meat into tablespoon-size balls (will make 15-16 meatballs).
3. In a 9×13 inch baking dish, combine the meatballs, **olive oil**, **lemon peel**, **dill**, and **chili flakes**. Bake 8-10 minutes, until just starting to get crisp. Reduce the oven to 400° F.
4. To the meatballs, add the dry **orzo**. Pour over 2 cups of water and the **wine**, stir to combine. Season with **salt** and **pepper**. Place the **spinach** on top. Bake for 12-15 minutes until most of the water has cooked into the pasta, but not all of it.
5. Stir the pasta around, mix in the **cream**, then sprinkle the **cheese** overtop. Bake another 10 minutes until the cheese has melted and the sauce is bubbling. If there's a lot of oil on top, drain off the excess. Top with fresh **dill**, **basil**, or **micro greens**.
