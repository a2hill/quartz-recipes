# Method
1. For the Marinade: Beat egg white in a large bowl until broken down and lightly foamy. Add **soy sauce**, **wine**, and **vodka** and whisk to combine. Set aside half of marinade in a small bowl. Add **baking soda** and **cornstarch** to the large bowl and whisk to combine. Add **chicken** to large bowl and turn with fingers to coat thoroughly. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.
2. For the Dry Coat: Combine **flour**, **cornstarch**, **baking powder**, and **1/2 teaspoon salt** in a large bowl. Whisk until homogenous. Add reserved marinade and whisk until mixture has coarse, mealy clumps. Set aside.
3. For the Sauce: Combine **soy sauce**, **wine**, **vinegar**, **chicken stock**, **sugar**, **sesame seed oil**, **orange zest and juice**, and **cornstarch** in a small bowl and stir with a fork until cornstarch is dissolved and no lumps remain. Add **dried orange peel**. Set aside.
4. Combine **oil**, **garlic**, **ginger**, and **minced scallions** in a large skillet and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are aromatic and soft, but not browned, about 3 minutes. Stir sauce mixture and add to skillet, making sure to scrape up any sugar or starch that has sunk to the bottom. Cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens, about 1 minute. Transfer sauce to a bowl to stop cooking, but don't wipe out skillet.
5. To Finish: Heat **1 1/2 quarts peanut, vegetable, or canola oil** in a large wok or Dutch oven to 350째F (177째C) and adjust flame to maintain temperature.
6. Working one piece at a time, transfer chicken from marinade to dry coat mixture, tossing in between each addition to coat chicken. When all chicken is added to dry coat, toss with hands, pressing dry mixture onto chicken so it adheres, and making sure that every piece is coated thoroughly.
7. Lift chicken one piece at a time, shake off excess coating, and carefully lower into hot oil (do not drop it). Once all chicken is added, cook, agitating with long chopsticks or a metal spider, and adjusting flame to maintain a temperature of 325 to 375째F (163-190째), until chicken is cooked through and very crispy, about 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a paper towel-lined bowl to drain.
8. Add chicken to empty skillet and return sauce to skillet. Toss chicken, folding it with a rubber spatula until all pieces are thoroughly coated. Serve immediately with white rice.
