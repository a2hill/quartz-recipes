## Description
The perfect sausage for a [[Sausage Breakfast Sandwiches]]

---
## Notes
### 2023-11-12
* Didn't salt ahead of time (although I think this is always how its been done)
* Be sure to actually weigh the turkey meat out before scaling the recipe as I didn't and then realized that it was bone in and I would need to subtract out weight
### 1/8/23
- Seemed too wet while mixing, need to taste and see though
    - after tasting: really nice texture
- Probably wouldn't bother with the skin again as it was a pain while grinding
- Anjali says too much pork flavor
