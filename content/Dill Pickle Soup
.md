# Method
1. Prepare your veggies. Dice **carrots**, dice **onion**, dice **pickles**, and peel and chop **potatoes**.
2. Chop your **bacon** and add to a cold frying pan. Bring the pan up to heat until the bacon is cooked to your desired doneness (I cooked until slightly crispy).
3. Remove your bacon bits from the pan and pour the fat into a large soup pot.
4. Add diced **onion** to the pot and cook in the bacon fat until translucent and fragrant.
5. Combine **chicken broth**, **pickle juice**, diced **pickles**, diced **carrots**, chopped **potatoes**, and **butter** in the pot.
6. Bring to a boil and cook until the **potatoes** are tender.
7. Once tender, turn the pot to low so it simmers.
