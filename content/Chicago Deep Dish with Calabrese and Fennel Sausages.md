# Description
This pie, filled with sausage and cheese, is the quintessential Chicago deep-dish pizza and a great choice for your first foray. I like a combo of spicy Calabrese and sweet fennel sausages and both mozzarella and provolone for the cheese. Some pizzerias press out a sheet of sausage that forms a solid layer over the cheese. I prefer to pinch quarter-size pieces of sausage and distribute them evenly, which makes for a less heavy pizza.

# Method
1. Remove the dough ball from the refrigerator and leave wrapped at room temperature until the dough warms to 55ºF to 60°F. Meanwhile, set up the oven with two pizza stones or baking steels and preheat to 500°F for 1 hour (see Getting Started, page 29).
2. Butter the bottom and sides of a 12 by 2-inch or 13 by 2-inch round deep-dish pizza pan.
3. Dust the work surface with a generous amount of cornmeal, then transfer the dough to the surface (see Transferring the Dough to the Work Surface, page 30). Coat both sides of the dough with the cornmeal, and roll out the dough into a 17-inch round (see Rolling Pizza Dough, page 103).
4. Working quickly but carefully, lift the dough round and lower it into the center of the prepared pan. Lift the edges of the dough to ease the dough into the corners. The dough will overhang the rim of the pan O. Press around the edge of the dough to secure it to the pan rim ®. Set aside to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
5. Arrange the mozzarella slices in the bottom and slightly up the sides of the pan, overlapping the slices as necessary ®. Pinch quarter-size pieces of the sausages and distribute them evenly over the cheese.
6. Sprinkle with a light dusting of pecorino and the garlic. Arrange the provolone slices over the top. Run the rolling pin over the lip of the pan to cut away the excess dough. If the dough shrinks back, use your fingers to press the dough around the inside of the pan, extending it to the lip.

8. Place the pan on the bottom stone. Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan 180 degrees, and continue to bake for another 12 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the crust is a rich golden brown.
9. Take the pan out of the oven and sprinkle the shredded mozzarella over the top of the pizza. Place on the top stone for 2 minutes to melt the shredded cheese.
10. Remove from the oven and run a long metal spatula around the inside of the pan to loosen the pizza from the pan. Then, using the spatula, lift an edge and check the bottom of the crust. It should be browned and crisp.
11. If it needs more time, return the pan to the bottom stone for 1 minute.
12. Using the spatula, and being careful not to pierce the bottom of the crust, lift the pizza from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board. Using a rocking cutter or a serrated knife, cut the pizza into 6 large wedges, leaving them in place. Spoon the sauce over the pizza and spread it to the edges with a small offset spatula. Finish with a dusting of pecorino and oregano and a drizzle of oil.
