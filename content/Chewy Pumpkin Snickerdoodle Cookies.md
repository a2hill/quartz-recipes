# Description

These pumpkin snickerdoodle cookies are super chewy and gooey! Each cookie is packed with fall flavors like brown butter, pumpkin spice, and cinnamon sugar. This viral recipe is a twist on my popular brown butter snickerdoodles that requires no chill time and no mixer!

# Method

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F/180 C. Line two baking trays with parchment paper and set them aside.

2. Brown the butter in a large stainless steel pan. This will take about 9-11 minutes. While it cooks it will foam, pop, and crackle. This is normal! Stand nearby, watch, and stir it occasionally so it doesnâ€™t burn.

3. When the bottom is covered in brown bits of butter and it smells nutty, remove the pan from the heat. You should have just slightly under 1 cup of browned butter (184 grams). Pour it into a bowl and set it aside to cool to room temperature. Once room temperature, chill the butter in the fridge until it feels cold to the touch but is NOT solid, about 70 F. The butter must be cool but still liquid!

4. Place the pumpkin puree on a plate. Use a few paper towels to press into it and soak up the extra liquid. You should do this with a new paper towel each time until the pumpkin feels pretty dry like soft playdough, and now measures roughly 1/3 cup (65-75 grams).

5. When the butter is cool, whisk in the brown sugar and granulated sugar for 1 minute. It should look like wet sand.

6. Whisk in the egg yolks, vanilla, and dried pumpkin puree.

7. Fold in the flour, pumpkin spice, salt, cream of tartar, and baking soda until just combined. Set the bowl of dough in the fridge for 5 minutes to firm up.

8. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the cinnamon and the sugar. Scoop the dough into 3 tbsp-sized balls and roll each dough ball in the cinnamon sugar. Place it on the prepared baking sheet spaced 2-3 inches apart.

9. Bake the cookies one tray at a time for 10-11 minutes or until the edges are golden brown and the middle is puffy and slightly underbaked. Do not overbake or the cookies will be puffy and cakier. Let the tray cool completely on a wire rack then enjoy!

10. Store leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 days. If you choose to freeze the cookie dough balls, let them come to room temperature before baking!
