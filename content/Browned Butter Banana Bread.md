# Description
This recipe for Browned Butter Banana Bread is a delicious twist on the classic banana bread recipe. The browned butter adds a rich, nutty flavor that pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the bananas. Serve it warm with a swipe of butter and a sprinkle of flaky Maldon salt for a truly indulgent treat.

# Method
<!-- In this section, any time you reference an ingredient (onions, chicken, cheese, garlic, etc.) be sure to bold it. For example 'Add the garlic' becomes 'Add the **garlic**'. Don't forget about things like **salt** **pepper** and **seasonings** which may not have been listed in the ingredients --> 
1. Grease a 9-inch-by-5-inch loaf pan and preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a medium-sized pan over medium heat, add 1 cup of **butter** and allow it to begin melting. Browning butter takes time, so you just need to let it do its thing. Once it melts completely, it will start to bubble and foam a bit and then the milk solids will separate from the butter. Swirl the butter in the pan. The milk solids will be underneath the foam, and might be hard to see. Once you can see that the milk solids have turned slightly brown, pull the browned butter off the stove, and let cool. You should have about ¾ of a cup of browned butter, give or take.
3. In a small bowl, mash **bananas**. Then whisk **sugar**, **eggs**, and **vanilla bean paste** into the mashed bananas and set aside.
4. In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients — **flour**, **baking soda** and **salt**. Set aside.
5. Mix in the cooled brown butter into the banana and egg mixture and make sure everything is completely combined.
6. Combine the dry ingredients and wet ingredients and any additional add-ins until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
7. Pour into your baking dish and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes; a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.
8. Cool in pan for 10 to 15 minutes, turn out and serve warm. I like to serve mine with a swipe of butter and some flaky **Maldon salt**.
