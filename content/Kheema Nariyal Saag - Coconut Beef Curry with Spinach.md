# Description
If you grew up eating Indian food-either at home or in a restaurant-you're likely to have seen the word saag before. Any dish you add greens to is a saag, and typically it's spinach, as used here. This curry takes on an extra-rich flavor and thickness with the addition of coconut milk. Coconut milk tends to get a little thin when pressure cooked, so you add half at the beginning and save the other half to add after the dish is cooked. SERVES 4

# Method
1. Preheat the Instant Pot® by selecting Sauté and adjust to More for high heat.
2. When the inner cooking pot is hot, add the **ghee**.
3. When the **ghee** is shimmering, add the **cumin seeds** and cook until they sputter like popcorn popping, about 1 minute.
4. Add the **garlic** and **ginger**, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until they start to sizzle and flavor the oil.
5. Add the **ground beef** and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lumps have largely broken up, about 4 minutes.
6. Add the **onion**, **tomato**, **chile**, **turmeric**, **cayenne**, **coriander**, **garam masala**, **salt**, **spinach**, **water**, and half the can of **coconut milk**. Stir to combine.
7. Lock the lid into place. Select Manual and adjust the pressure to High. Cook for 10 minutes.
8. When the cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally.
9. Unlock the lid and stir in the remaining half of the **coconut milk** to add thickness.
