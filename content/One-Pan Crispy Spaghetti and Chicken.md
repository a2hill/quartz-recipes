# Description
Yotam tested this dish out on his two little ones, the most brutally honest of critics, who were so keen that they asked for it two nights in a row-a true testament to midweek dinner success. To top this off, it is easy to prepare and fun to eat and doesn't call upon any hard-to-source ingredients. Cooking the spaghetti in this way lends plenty of texture, allowing for crispier bits around the edges and softer bits throughout.

# Ingredients
- [ ] 2 tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 6 chicken thighs, skin on and bone in (1 lb 9 oz/700g)
- [ ] 1 large onion, cut into ½-inch/1cm dice (1½ cups/220g)
- [ ] 4 garlic cloves, sliced
- [ ] 2 tbsp thyme leaves, divided 1T, 1T
	- You can substitute whatever soft herbs you have on hand
- [ ] 3 tbsp tomato paste
- [ ] 600ml chicken stock, divided 450/150
- [ ] 9 oz/250g dried spaghetti, broken into thirds
	- [ ] You can substitute any long skinny pasta, like bucatini
- [ ] ¼ cup/20g finely grated Parmesan
	- You can substitute whatever hard cheese you have on hand
- [ ] Parmesan rind (a few pieces)
- [ ] ¼ cup/20g fresh breadcrumbs, finely blitzed
- [ ] ½ cup/10g parsley or cilantro, finely chopped
	- We used cilantro last time and it was great
- [ ] 1½ tsp finely grated lemon zest
- [ ] salt and black pepper

# Method
1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. Put 1 tablespoon of oil into a large, oven-safe sauté pan, for which you have a lid, and place on high heat. Season the **chicken** with **¾ teaspoon of salt** and plenty of **pepper** and add to the hot **oil**, skin side down. Let cook for 7 minutes, without turning over, to brown well.
3. Flip **chicken** and cook for another 5 minutes
4. Turn the heat down to medium-high, then add the **onion** and stir. Cook for 5 minutes, until the **onion** has softened and is lightly browned. 
5. Add the **garlic**, 1 tablespoon of **thyme**, and all the **tomato paste** and cook, stirring, for 1 minute more. 
6. Arrange the **chicken** skin side up, **450ml of chicken stock**, and **Parmesan rind** and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has reduced. 
7. Add another **150ml of chicken stock** (add less if you want your spaghetti to be more crispy), **½ teaspoon salt** (you might be able to back this off if your stock is salted like ours is), and a good **grind of pepper**, then add the **spaghetti**, stirring to submerge and evenly distribute it. Use tongs to lift the chicken pieces so that they sit on top of the spaghetti, skin side up. 
8. Bring to a simmer, cover with the lid, and bake in the oven for 30 minutes, at which stage all the liquid should have been absorbed.
9. Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix together the **Parmesan**, **breadcrumbs**, **parsley/cilantro**, **lemon zest**, and the remaining **1 tablespoon of thyme**.
10. After 30 minutes in the oven, remove the pasta pan and reset the oven broiler to high. Sprinkle the **breadcrumb mix** over the pasta and chicken, drizzle with the **remaining oil**, and broil for 3-4 minutes, until nicely browned and crisp. 
11. Allow to settle for 5 minutes before serving warm, directly from the pan.
