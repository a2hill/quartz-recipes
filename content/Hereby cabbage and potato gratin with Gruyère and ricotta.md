# Description
![[image.jpg]]

Multiple layers of flavor make this gratin subtly special, the first being two types of garlic: sweet, sticky, and roasted, and then raw and pungent. The second being a multitude of herbs and cheeses in between lavers of potato, shallots, and cabbage. It is as lovely to look at as it is to eat, and can be served as is, or alongside your protein of choice.

# Method
1. ﻿﻿﻿Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Drizzle the garlic heads with 1 teaspoon of oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. Wrap each individually in foil and roast for 40 minutes, until softened and golden. Remove the foil and, when cool enough to handle, squeeze out the cloves, discarding the papery skins.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Meanwhile, prepare the rest of the vegetables. Combine the potatoes, shallots, and paprika in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of oil, ¾ teaspoon of salt, and plenty of pepper.
5. ﻿﻿﻿Toss the cabbage leaves together with 1 tablespoon of oil, ⅓ teaspoon of salt, and plenty of pepper.
6. ﻿﻿﻿Finely chop the three extra garlic cloves and mix together with all the herbs, the green onions, lemon zest, and the roasted garlic. Reserve a quarter of this mixture and set aside, to serve.
7. ﻿﻿﻿Assemble the gratin. Arrange a third of the cabbage leaves in the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch /23 × 33cm high-sided baking dish. Cover with half the potato mixture and a third of the herb mixture. Dot half of the ricotta and Gruyère randomly over the herbs. Repeat this once more, then top with a final layer of cabbage and the remaining third of the herb mixture.
8. ﻿﻿﻿Combine the stock, lemon juice, and ¼ teaspoon of salt and pour this evenly over the top, lifting some of the cabbage leaves up so the liquid sinks down. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 80 minutes, until the vegetables are soft. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and return to the oven, uncovered, for 15 minutes, to brown. Let cool for 10 minutes, then top with the reserved herb mixture.
