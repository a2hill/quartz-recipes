# Description
Crafting a great deep-dish pizza takes some time and strategy. Because this style takes so long to bake, it's assembled differently from other kinds of pizza. About half of the cheese-in my versions, sliced part-skim mozzarella-goes on the bottom and slightly up the sides, where the ingredients that go on top of it protect it from burning during its long stay in the oven. It also acts as a "liner" between the crust and the filling to keep the crust crisp. Next come the filling ingredients and, finally, more cheese. Here, I like the saltier and more intense flavor of provolone to balance the mozzarella. Toward the end of baking, I add shredded mozzarella for just a few minutes to melt it. The cheeses are "staged" in this way so that they don't overcook and exude too much fat and moisture. Traditionally, the sauce is added to the unbaked pizza and cooks in the oven. That can make things soggy and messy. I prefer to warm the sauce briefly but not actually cook it and then add it on top, after the pie comes out of the oven. People are always surprised by that because they're used to the heavier, more concentrated flavor of a baked tomato sauce. Splitting up the baking process with all of these staged steps means that my deep-dish pies bake more quickly than what's typical, and that gives them more strength, structure, and definition. It's all about engineering the build and the bake to cook everything just right, so the crust stays crunchy, the filling comes together as a perfect blend of flavors and textures, and the sauce adds a bright, fresh accent to balance all the richness.

# Ingredients
- [ ] 1 round deep-dish pan (12-13 inches in diameter, 2 inches deep)
- [ ] Part-skim mozzarella cheese
- [ ] Provolone cheese
- [ ] Pizza sauce
- [ ] Pizza toppings (e.g. pepperoni, sausage)
- [ ] Unsalted butter
- [ ] Lard or vegetable shortening
- [ ] Medium-grind cornmeal

# Method
1. Preheat oven to 475Â°F.
2. Grease the deep-dish pan liberally.
3. Layer half of the part-skim mozzarella cheese on the bottom and slightly up the sides of the pan.
4. Add the filling ingredients on top of the cheese.
5. Layer the remaining part-skim mozzarella cheese and provolone cheese on top of the filling.
6. Bake the pizza for 30 minutes.
7. Warm the pizza sauce briefly and add it on top of the pizza after it comes out of the oven.
8. Let the pizza sit for 30 minutes before slicing and serving.
9. Optional: Transfer the pizza to a clean, room-temperature pan before serving. Alternatively, serve directly from the cutting board.
10. Optional: Add final sauce, seasonings, and garnishes after the pizza is sliced and out of the pan.
