# Method
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan and line with parchment paper.
2. In a small saucepan, combine the blueberries, 1/2 cup of sugar, lemon juice, and 1 tsp of vanilla. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the blueberries burst and the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes.
3. In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch with 1 tbsp of water. Add the cornstarch mixture to the blueberry mixture and cook for an additional 2 minutes, until the mixture is thick and glossy. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and 1/2 cup of sugar until light and fluffy. Add 1 tsp of vanilla and mix until well combined.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing until a dough forms.
6. Press the dough into the prepared baking pan, making sure it is evenly distributed. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.
7. In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add 1 cup of sugar and 1 tbsp of cornstarch, mixing until well combined.
8. Add the sour cream, 1 tbsp of vanilla, and lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture, mixing until smooth.
9. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing until just combined after each addition.
10. Pour the cream cheese mixture over the baked crust, spreading it evenly. Drop spoonfuls of the blueberry mixture on top of the cream cheese mixture, then use a knife to swirl the two together.
11. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still slightly jiggly.
12. Allow the bars to cool completely before refrigerating for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
13. Once chilled, cut into squares and serve. Enjoy!
