# Method
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 9x13 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the bars out easily after baking.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine the **blueberries**, 1/2 cup of **sugar**, **lemon juice**, **vanilla**, and **cornstarch**. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and the **blueberries** burst, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool.
3. In a large bowl, beat together the softened **butter**, 1/2 cup of **sugar**, and 1 tsp of **vanilla** until light and fluffy. Add the **flour** and **salt**, and mix until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking pan.
4. In another large bowl, beat the softened **cream cheese** until smooth. Add 1 cup of **sugar** and 1 tbsp of **cornstarch**, and beat until creamy. Add the **sour cream**, 1 tbsp of **vanilla**, and **lemon zest**, and mix until smooth. Add the **eggs** one at a time, beating well after each addition.
5. Pour the **cream cheese** mixture over the prepared crust. Spoon the cooled **blueberry** mixture on top and use a knife to swirl it into the **cream cheese** mixture.
6. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly. 
7. Let the bars cool completely at room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 3 hours before cutting into squares and serving.
