# Description
Adding cream to the pan before you bake the rolls keeps the bottoms from drying out and makes for a nice addition to the provided icing.

# Ingredients
- [ ] 1 tube of store bought cinnamon rolls
	- I prefer Pillsbury's, the one with 5 rolls in a tube and the Cinnabon cream cheese icing
- [ ] Heavy Cream

# Method
1. Pre-heat oven
2. Cover the bottom of a 9x9 pan with heavy cream, about 1/4"
3. Place the cinnamon rolls in the pan and bake
4. When golden brown, remove the cinnamon rolls to a wire rack and take the leftover cream and mix *some* of it with the icing
	1. You don't want the icing to be too thin
5. Ice the rolls
