 > Tried cooking these at different temperatures in the pizza oven, and also in the cast iron
 > For the pizza oven:
 > * Low heat gave a nice texture, however it didn't brown like we would have liked
 > * At a higher temp they brown nicely, however a hot stone tends to create a thin bottom with a thick top (ideally we'd want the top and bottom to be the same thickness)
 > For the cast iron:
 > * The heat is too uneven to get uniform browning, and so you end up with hot spots
 > ## Next Time
 > * Cook in the pizza oven at a low stone temperature and increase the fire when you launch them (so that they brown)

# Method
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the **flour**, **yeast**, **sugar**, **oil**, and **salt**.
2. Gradually add the **warm water** to the mixture, stirring until a dough forms.
3. Knead the dough for 10 minutes on a floured surface.
4. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and form a roll.
5. Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces and roll each piece into a smooth ball.
6. Place the dough balls between 2 towels and let them rise for 7 minutes.
7. Lightly flour a surface and roll each dough ball into a thin pita, about 3 mm thick.
8. Place the pitas on a towel and cover with another towel, letting them rise for half an hour.
9. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat for 5 minutes.
10. Gently transfer a pita to the pan with the side that was on the towel touching the pan first.
11. Wait about 15-20 seconds until small bubbles form, then flip the pita.
12. Cook for another 10-15 seconds, then flip again and cook until the pita puffs up and browns.
13. Repeat with the remaining pitas.
14. Serve and enjoy your homemade pita bread!
