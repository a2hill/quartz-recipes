 > After re-reading the directions and proofing the pita on a towel (with another towel over it), I had the opposite problem from last time: the bottoms were underdone and I didn't get the poof I wanted. 
 > 
 > I think the right move is to cook them like a pizza, get the stone hot (the bottoms which are moist from the towel will need the heat), and then moderate the top heat to get the right doneness

# Method
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the **flour**, **yeast**, **sugar**, **oil**, and **salt**.
2. Gradually add the **warm water** to the mixture, stirring until a dough forms.
3. Knead the dough for 10 minutes on a floured surface.
4. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and form a roll.
5. Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces and roll each piece into a smooth ball.
6. Place the dough balls between 2 towels and let them rise for 7 minutes.
7. Lightly flour a surface and roll each dough ball into a thin pita, about 3 mm thick.
8. Place the pitas on a towel and cover with another towel, letting them rise for half an hour.
9. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat for 5 minutes.
10. Gently transfer a pita to the pan with the side that was on the towel touching the pan first.
11. Wait about 15-20 seconds until small bubbles form, then flip the pita.
12. Cook for another 10-15 seconds, then flip again and cook until the pita puffs up and browns.
13. Repeat with the remaining pitas.
14. Serve and enjoy your homemade pita bread!
