# Method
1. Choose a sauté pan that can subsequently contain all the chicken pieces without crowding them. Fry **bacon** and set aside.
3. Add **olive oil**, and turn the heat to medium high. Fry the **chicken** skin side down for 6 minutes. Flip chicken and cook for another 6 minutes. Remove chicken from pan.
4. With heat on medium add the **sliced onion** (and more olive oil if necessary). Cook the onion, turning it occasionally, until it becomes translucent.
5.  Add the **sliced garlic**, **thyme**, **rosemary**, **red pepper flakes**, **salt**, several grindings of **pepper**, cook until fragrant.
6.  Add **wine**. Let it simmer away until about half of it has evaporated.
7.  Add the cut-up **tomatoes**, and a bit more salt, and bring to a simmer. Allow the tomatoes to cook down slightly.
8. Return chicken pieces to pan nestling them into the mixture. Turn down the heat to cook at an intermittent simmer, and cover the pan, putting the lid on slightly askew. If you find that the liquid in the pan becomes insufficient, add 2 tablespoons of water. Cook until the chicken thighs feel very tender when prodded with a fork, and the meat comes easily off the bone, about 40 minutes.
9. To serve, spoon some of the sauce into a high sided plate and place the chicken on top. Grate fresh parmesan on top, and chiffon some parsley if you have it
