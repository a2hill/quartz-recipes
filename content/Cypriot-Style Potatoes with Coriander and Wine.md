# Description
This specialty of Cyprus, where "tossed" baby potatoes are combined with wine and spices, was taught to us by Greek food writer and mentor Aglaia Kremezi. She told us it's important to not only crack the **coriander seeds**— the telltale spice of Cypriot dishes —but the potatoes as well, so they can absorb all the flavor from the simmering wine and then develop a crispy crust from the **olive oil**. The semisweet rosé wine commonly used can be difficult to find, so we like to use dry rosé and a touch of **honey**. We also like to add **cilantro**, which lends color and echoes the flavor of the traditional coriander seed in this dish.

# Method
1. Place the potatoes in a pot large enough to hold them in one layer with a little room to spare. Pour in the **olive oil**, season with a large pinch of **salt**, and add water to halfway cover the potatoes. Bring the potatoes to a simmer over high heat, then cook until the water has evaporated and the potatoes start to gently fry, about 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, put the **coriander seeds** on a cutting board, cover with a dish towel, and use a rolling pin or the side of a chef's knife to coarsely crack the seeds. Brush the cracked seeds into a small mixing bowl and set aside.
3. As the potatoes fry, reduce the heat to medium and gently crack them one by one with the back of a ladle or potato masher; you want to slightly crush them while still keeping most of their shape.
4. Continue frying until the exposed potato begins to brown and get crispy.
5. Once the potatoes are browned, add the **coriander seeds** and toss until aromatic, about 1 minute.
6. Add the **wine** and **honey** and continue cooking until the liquid is absorbed and concentrates, about 2 minutes. Stir in the **cilantro**, season to taste with **salt**, and serve warm.
